## 🚆 My road to coding

### 🤓 Self-taught

[**My projects**](https://codepen.io/0Bubbles0) following the freeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design course.

### 🎓 [**@foundersandcoders**](https://github.com/foundersandcoders) bootcamp - Cohort 22

1. My [**application**](https://github.com/0bubbles0/fac-22-application) to the course, which is also a good introduction to me 🙂
1. My [**early projects**](https://github.com/0bubbles0/fac22-pre-projects) when I was accepted into the pre-course
1. The [**course projects**](https://github.com/fac22/projects-gallery) of the fac22 cohort at
1. My [**team's final project**](https://github.com/tech-for-better/in-common), which allowed our client **inCommon** to secure grant funding 🌟🎉

### 👩‍💻 Commercial experience

Working at a fast-paced Start up, I love quickly adapting to new challenges to plan and deliver reliable software solutions across the stack.

I am always eager to hear stories and experiences from other developers, so please connect with me, raise Issues in my repos with feedback, recommendations or ask me for advice yourself! 👍

<!--
🌱*Current Program*: Pre-apprenticeship with **Founders and Coders Cohort 22**

🌱 *This week*, I’m learning about **using APIs**

🌱*Previously*, I learned more about
  - Semantic **HTML**5
  - **CSS**3 (flexbox, grid, BEM)
  - **JavaScript** & DOM manipulation (async, Promises)
  - **Accessibility** (WCAG standards, colour contrasts, assistive tools)
  - **Git**

🌱 Some Tools that I have been using and learning about were
  - GitHub
  - VS Code, Terminal
  - Figma, Notion, colour palette generators, screen reader

🌱 I'm always learning, follow my journey!

Over the last months, my developer skills have been continuously growing and especially thrived with the influence of my fellow fac22 cohorters, who constantly inspire me with their visual creativity and coding approaches and encourage me to pitch in with support for bugs they encounter.

If you'd like to view my progress yourself, please visit
  - <https://codepen.io/0Bubbles0>: The entirely self-taught first attempt at the **freeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design** projects on Codepen back in February/March 2021
  - <https://github.com/0bubbles0/fac-22-application>: My **application to fac22**, which showcases my learnings from the fac Coaching program and is also a good introduction to my life, values and ideas from May 2021
  - <https://github.com/0bubbles0/fac22-pre-projects>: The home of my learnings and areas of focus during the **pre-apprenticesip program**, which keeps changing every day

The coming months will be very exciting, as our cohort will be diving into topics such as **React**, **Databases**, **Testing** and **Deployment** to really round our developer toolkits. Personally, I will also be working on improving my design and accessibility skills, so that I can very soon make an impact by helping to bring real solutions and visions to life!
